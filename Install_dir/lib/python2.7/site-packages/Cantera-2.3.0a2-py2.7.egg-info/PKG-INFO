Description: 
        Cantera is a suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving
        chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and/or transport processes.
        
        Cantera provides types (or classes) of objects representing phases of
        matter, interfaces between these phases, reaction managers, time-dependent
        reactor networks, and steady one-dimensional reacting flows. Cantera is
        currently used for applications including combustion, detonations,
        electrochemical energy conversion and storage, fuel cells, batteries, aqueous
        electrolyte solutions, plasmas, and thin film deposition.
        
        Cantera can be used from Python and Matlab, or in applications written
        in C++ and Fortran 90.
